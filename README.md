# React Native Animations

These are the branch names of each of the code examples. The reason they are on branches vs separate folders is to prevent you from having to keep installing React Native and all dependencies.

To access a demo just clone this repo. `git clone git@gitlab.com:codedaily/reactnativeanimations.git`

Once cloned do `git checkout [branchname]`

For example `git checkout timing` for the first code demo. Follow along with the getting setup video if you are having any issues.

Additionally each of these is a link to the code on gitlab if you would like to view the code online.

If you've made modifications and it will not let you check out another demo just run the command
`git reset --hard`. This will reset everything, so be warned if you have pieces of a demo you have modified and want to keep.
